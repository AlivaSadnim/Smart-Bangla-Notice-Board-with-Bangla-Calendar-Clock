# Smart-Bangla-Notice-Board-with-Bangla-Calendar-Clock
Our project, Bangla Notice Board with Calendar Clock uses an esp8266 module and LED dot matrix to implement scrolling of Bangla Notice, date and time. The goal of the project is to construct a Bangla Notice Board with time that is more visually appealing than earlier versions.
